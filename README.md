## Deep-Learning
This repository is a combination of lab exercices and a project about Deep Learning. We use Tensorflow 1.2

## Labs:
* Lab 1: Fully connected Neural net trained on IRIS dataset which contains contains 150 samples of three types of IRIS flowers
* Lab 2: Convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on CIFAR-10 dataset which contains 60k images split into 10 classes(planes, horses etc...
* Lab 3: Added batch normalisation and decaying learning rate to Lab 2
* Lab 4: Switched to tf.layers API and added some data augmentation
* Lab 5: Added adversarial training

## Project:
The goal was to reproduce the work of a Paper: "Comparing Shallow versus Deep Neural Network Architectures for Automatic Music Genre Classification", Alexander Schindler and Thomas Lidy and Andreas Rauber,2016.

The code produces similar results to those shown in the paper. It only uses one of the available datasets: GTZAN and does not implement the data augmentation part.
