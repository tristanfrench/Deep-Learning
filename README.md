##Project:
The goal was to reproduce the work of a Paper: "Comparing Shallow versus Deep Neural Network Architectures for Automatic Music Genre Classification"
Alexander Schindler and Thomas Lidy and Andreas Rauber,2016.

The code produces similar results to those shown in the paper. It only uses one of the available datasets: GTZAN and does not implement the data augmentation part.
