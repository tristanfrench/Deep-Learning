## Deep-Learning
This repository is Deep learning project. All of the code is written in Python with Tensorflow 1.2

## Project:
The goal was to reproduce the work of a Paper: [Comparing Shallow versus Deep Neural Network Architectures for Automatic Music Genre Classification](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Comparing-Shallow-versus-Deep-Neural-Network-for-Schindler-Lidy/1c5626c0658e7536d61bcc3c550f635eea5106c0), Alexander Schindler and Thomas Lidy and Andreas Rauber,2016.

The code produces similar results to those shown in the paper. It only uses one of the available datasets: GTZAN and does not implement the data augmentation part.
